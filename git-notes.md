5: Staged changes(added to the staging area through add command) will be committed to the project when we next run the commit command, unlike unstaged changes.
6: Any files that are in the working directory are untracked files, which are not in git, wheread tracked files are what git are keeping track of.
7: Git fetch just checks the repo for any new changes without actually transferring any files, while pull does. 
8: We raise pull requests in collaborative projects so that the additions/modification one contributor has made can be accepted/declined by the others.
