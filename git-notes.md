1: VCS versions out your source code, tracks history & helps teams work together. Helps improvement code management & team efficiency. 
2:Fork makes a seperate copy of your (forked) repository in your git repo. When you clone a repo, you recieve all the files on your local / target repository. Cloned repo is directly linked with git repo. F
3:Branches are created for adding new/extended features, bug fixes & to work independently. 
4.Fork makes an independent copy unlike branch, i.e. any change/modification/deletion to original repo doesn't affect fork repo. A branch content can differ depending on needs. 
5: Staged changes(added to the staging area through add command) will be committed to the project when we next run the commit command, unlike unstaged changes.
6: Any files that are in the working directory are untracked files, which are not in git, wheread tracked files are what git are keeping track of.
7: Git fetch just checks the repo for any new changes without actually transferring any files, while pull does. 
8: We raise pull requests in collaborative projects so that the additions/modification one contributor has made can be accepted/declined by the others. 
9: Best practices fo rnaming branches and writing commits is to start by what type of commit it is (fix, feat or chore) followed by what changes were made and for what purpose
10: new branch- $git branch "branchname", switch to different branch- $git checkout "branchname", both can be combined by using $git checkout -b "branchname"
11: yes we can add a new remote by using $git remote add remotename [remote URL]
12: git command for status of changesand commit history is $git log
13: ls-list directories, cd- change directory, mkdir- make new directory
14: using $git pull origin main
